## Special news for developers:
To get closer to the Open Source community, we are pleased to announce that since the 30th of August iTop code is available on the GitHub platform.



# iTop code moves to GitHub
The iTop project was hosted on a SourceForge project since its beginning in 2009. Combodo wants to ease collaboration with iTop developer community, and so we decided to move our code to the popular GitHub platform!


The iTop repository is part of the [GitHub Combodo](https://github.com/Combodo) organization. It can be used with either Git or SVN.
Any contributor can fork the code and submit contributions using GitHub pull requests !





## Important
[iTop SourceForge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/itop/) will still host:
 - [Forums](https://sourceforge.net/p/itop/discussion/): for support request
 - [Tickets](https://sourceforge.net/p/itop/tickets/): for feature requests and bug reports
 - [Releases download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/itop/files/itop/)

**Warning!** Starting of 30th august, you should get the code from GitHub only.
